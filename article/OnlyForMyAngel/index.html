									<p>So sorry for making you sad.<br>
										I was really sad about this.<br>
										Donâ€™t worry about any content of the article anymore, ok?<br>
										Itâ€™s wrong about virtual is more real and reality is not real.<br>
										I just want to maintain this relationship no matter what method, is this unreal?</p>
										
										<h4>I dare say you are the most beautiful girl I have ever met.</h4>
										
										But is it important?<br>
										The most important thing is you are the girl that I think is the most suitable for me at that moment.<br>
										Itâ€™s not easy to get into a formal relationship.<br>
										Two people pretend for getting better impression each other<br>
										to both who are honest with each other finallly.<br>
										Itâ€™s really valuable that both are willing to make a step closer first for going further.</p>
										
										<p>Desire is infinite.<br>
										Creature comforts will only spend more and more.<br>
										There will only be more handsome guys and beautiful women in the world.<br>
										Humanity is so vile.<br>
										But no one wants to be overwhelmed by their own desires.<br>
										Instead, really want to cherish what I have now.</p>
										<p>I want the relationship to be comfortable all the time.<br>
										Itâ€™s not correct that it means you donâ€™t love if you didnâ€™t do something.<br>
										Everyone has their own way and frequency to express love.<br>
										If love is must be a certain standard or I must to do something to reach the standard.<br>
										Then we should find an actor as a partner,<br>
										But actors donâ€™t want to act after get off work as well, right?</p>
										<p>I still think the definition of love is complicated.<br>
										Because everyoneâ€™s mindset and thinking is different.<br>
										But I willing to accompany you, want to do some boring things together just for fun.<br>
										I care about you, afraid that you will be sad, and I will also be sad when I see you sad.<br>
										Is this love?<br>
										I donâ€™t know either, but </p>
										<h4>I do know you mean a lot to me.</h4>
										<br>
